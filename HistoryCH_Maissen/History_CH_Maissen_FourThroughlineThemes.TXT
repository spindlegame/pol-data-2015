Four Througlines Themes Report

Overall Story Thematic Report for "Your Story"

The Overall Story of "Your Story" takes place in the Situation Throughline, indicating that the problem exists because there is something wrong with a situation or environment.  Additionally, the Overall characters are primarily Concerned with How Things are Changing.  So, putting it together, the Overall characters are concerned with a situation or environment pertaining to How Things are Changing.  Some of the Overall characters respond to How Things are Changing with Threat while others respond with Security.  Since this is part of the rational argument, an author can examine the relative practicality of responding to How Things are Changing with Threat or Security by illustrating their effects on Fantasy and Fact.  

Just because characters happen to find themselves on the same side because they share a particular approach does not mean they can agree on the essential nature of the problem or the best solution.  In "Your Story," some see Expectation as causing the problem and Determination as the means to resolve it.  Others are convinced that Theory is at the heart of the problem and Hunch will best solve it.

These two areas of disagreement (Threat vs. Security as an approach with Determination or Hunch as the solution) form four perspectives that conflict with each other over the course of the story.  Because they are so balanced, they tend to lock up like wrestlers and bring the plot to a halt.  Fortunately, like a referee, there is a Catalyst that moves in to break it up.  In "Your Story," Security is the Catalyst that gets things moving again.  However, once moving, the plot tends to pick up too much speed, as if the accelerator pedal were stuck to the floor.  Once again, a force comes into play to regulate the speed.  In "Your Story" this Inhibitor is Wisdom.  Any other means of arbitrating the speed of the plot might seem arbitrary.  However, because of their relationship to How Things are Changing, Security and Wisdom provide an author with unobtrusive tools to adjust the pacing of the story's progress.

Speed is one thing; distance to the destination is another.  That's where the Overall Story Benchmark comes into play.  The Benchmark serves as a yardstick providing milestones that tell an audience how far it is to the climax.  In "Your Story," distance to the goal is measured by changes in The Future.

In summary, the Overall problem in "Your Story" resides in a situation or environment pertaining to How Things are Changing.  Although the Overall characters share a Concern about How Things are Changing, they differ in approach:  some responding with Threat and others with Security.  The relative value of the two approaches becomes evident in the conflicts that occur between Threat and Security.  The relative practicality of both approaches is seen by how they each affect Fantasy and Fact.  In addition, the Overall characters disagree on the true cause of the problem, and therefore on the appropriate solution.  While some see Expectation as the problem and Determination the best solution, others find Theory at the heart of the problem and Hunch the best way to resolve it.  These perspectives come into conflicts that are moved forward by Security, and held back by Wisdom, while the distance to the goal is measured by changes in The Future.

Main vs. Impact Story Thematic Report for "Your Story"

The Main vs. Impact Story theme places value judgments on the relationship between the Main and Impact Characters.  In the relationship between The steadfast radicals (Jonas F and The apostate ultramontane (Cons, these value judgments center on Worry.  The Main vs. Impact Story Counterpoint provides an alternative standard of values in contrast to the thematic focus.  In "Your Story," this alternative value standard examines Confidence.  Conflicts occur between The steadfast radicals (Jonas F and The apostate ultramontane (Cons in regards to the relative value of Worry vs. Confidence.  It is the passionate argument that presents the emotional case for the author's point of view.  In fact, this bias forms the heart of the thematic exploration.  In "Your Story" the author's views can be explored in terms of Worry vs. Confidence.  Although Worry and Confidence describe both sides of the thematic argument, as author, you will need to take one side over the other in order to make a thematic statement in the passionate argument.  In "Your Story," your point of view can be expressed by examining both Worry and Confidence in terms of the contrast in worths and values between The steadfast radicals (Jonas F and The apostate ultramontane (Cons.

For most of the story, The steadfast radicals (Jonas F and The apostate ultramontane (Cons may spend a good deal of their time focusing on theorizing.  Although they will both agree that theorizing is the primary area of friction between them, one will argue that theorizing is the way to resolve their personal problems, while the other will argue that intuiting is the way to go.

Having taken up sides on all of these issues, The steadfast radicals (Jonas F and The apostate ultramontane (Cons would simply sit on their own positions and the passionate argument of "Your Story" would be reduced to a shouting match in which no progress is made toward a resolution.  However, there is another thematic aspect to the story that breaks the log jam and keeps the plot moving along.  In "Your Story" this Catalyst is Confidence.  Any other way of moving the plot along might seem artificial, however every time Confidence gets things moving, it somehow seems appropriate, due to the relationship between Worry and Confidence.

In contrast, if the plot moved forward without any resistance, the story would end before all sides of all issues could be explored.  That's why in "Your Story" Knowledge serves to inhibit progress toward a solution.  It is the balance between Confidence and Knowledge that determines how quickly the passionate argument will move forward.  In fact, in working with this story you can increase the pace toward the climax by adding in more Confidence (or strengthening its presence) or slow down the story to linger at points of special interest by adding more Knowledge.  Even more variety can be achieved by lowering the presence of Confidence or Knowledge to make the story move slower or faster, respectively.

Putting the items in place that will change the pace of a story makes an audience feel they are rushing, crawling or any speed in between on the way to the climax of the story.  In the Main vs. Impact Story, this climax is reached when the relationship between the Main and Impact characters grows to its maximum dimensions.  In "Your Story" the growth between The steadfast radicals (Jonas F and The apostate ultramontane (Cons is measured in terms of Innermost Desires.  What is was driven, then, becomes the thematic yardstick that clues the audience in as to the distance to the climax of the passionate argument.

In summary, the Main vs. Impact Storyline of "Your Story" involves a divergence between The steadfast radicals (Jonas F and The apostate ultramontane (Cons in terms of Worry vs. Confidence.  The author takes sides by examining their worths and values.  Still, The steadfast radicals (Jonas F and The apostate ultramontane (Cons spend most of their time focusing on theorizing.  The passionate argument is moved forward by Confidence, held back by Knowledge, and the audience can measure progress toward the climax in terms of what is was driven.

Main Character Story Thematic Report for "Your Story"

In "Your Story," The steadfast radicals (Jonas F's Throughline is an activity or endeavor.  In fact, The steadfast radicals (Jonas F's Concerns revolve around an activity or endeavor of Doing.  This is not necessarily The steadfast radicals (Jonas F's goal (although it could be) but is better thought of as his primary Concern.  

The steadfast radicals (Jonas F proves to be sensitive to issues pertaining to Wisdom, especially in reference to Doing.  In fact, when it comes to Doing, The steadfast radicals (Jonas F often notices a disparity between Wisdom and Enlightenment that others just don't see.  The audience, therefore, is provided a very personal commentary on the meaning of Doing through The steadfast radicals (Jonas F's perspective.

As the story develops we learn that The steadfast radicals (Jonas F's motivation comes from an imbalance between Proven and Unproven.  Specifically, what drives The steadfast radicals (Jonas F forward through the story is an over abundance of Proven.

In fact, The steadfast radicals (Jonas F's excess of Proven is what gets him into trouble.  In addition, this imbalance causes trouble for everyone else as well.  However, only if The steadfast radicals (Jonas F continues to believe that his own over abundance of Proven is not really causing all the problems but is just the work he must do to resolve the problems will he be able to set things right.  The question is, will he be able to hold on to his resolve long enough?

What moves The steadfast radicals (Jonas F forward is that his focus is on the problem.  The steadfast radicals (Jonas F doesn't see the problem to be in himself.  Rather, he believes the problem to be Theory and sees Hunch as the solution.  As a result, The steadfast radicals (Jonas F will make progress toward the solution unless he begins to doubt himself, and comes to believe that he is preventing the problem from being solved.

Although The steadfast radicals (Jonas F is also interested in working toward the goal regarding How Things are Changing that everyone seems concerned with, he finds himself indispensable on the quest because of his Abilities in the area of Skill.  Actually, The steadfast radicals (Jonas F is Uniquely Able in this area, which is why he cannot resist participating in the quest where he begins to see that he holds the means to resolving the story's problems.

The steadfast radicals (Jonas F's Unique Ability of Skill can move the story toward a positive conclusion.  However, his use of Skill is undermined by an aspect of Fact which always seems to get in the way.  This resistance to his effectiveness varies as The steadfast radicals (Jonas F grows over the course of the story.  It becomes clear that when The steadfast radicals (Jonas F can overcome his Fact and effectively rely on Skill, he may be able to address the fact that he has the power to resolve the story's problems.  This tug of war between Skill and Fact causes both growth and backsliding in The steadfast radicals (Jonas F, as evidenced by his varying degree of Obtaining.

In summary, an activity or endeavor is the realm in which The steadfast radicals (Jonas F primarily operates, especially in regard to Doing, which is his chief Concern.  As an individual, The steadfast radicals (Jonas F is focused on issues involving Wisdom more than most, which makes him responsive to issues regarding Enlightenment.  He often perceives a disparity between Wisdom and Enlightenment.  The steadfast radicals (Jonas F is driven by an over abundance of Proven, which causes him to see Theory as the source of his problems and Hunch as the best solution.  In fact, The steadfast radicals (Jonas F's own excess of Proven is what allows the story's problem to be resolved.  The steadfast radicals (Jonas F is given the opportunity to see this as he becomes wholly involved in the effort to achieve the goal.  It is The steadfast radicals (Jonas F's Unique Ability pertaining to Skill that holds the means to resolving the story's problem.  Unfortunately, his effectiveness is undermined by an aspect of Fact.  Over the course of the story The steadfast radicals (Jonas F's growth (and backsliding) in effectiveness can be seen in the degree to which he engages in Obtaining.

Impact Character Story Thematic Report for "Your Story"

In "Your Story," The apostate ultramontane (Cons is the impact character, meaning that we see The apostate ultramontane (Cons as the primary influence on The steadfast radicals (Jonas F's personal fulfillment.  In fact, The steadfast radicals (Jonas F is on the right path, and The apostate ultramontane (Cons pressures him to take a worse approach.  As a Manipulation character, The apostate ultramontane (Cons works through manipulation.  

With regard to that "manner of thinking", The apostate ultramontane (Cons is primarily Concerned with Playing a Role, especially in terms of Knowledge.  In fact, it is the discrepancy between Knowledge and Thought that is most exemplified by The apostate ultramontane (Cons.  Driving a wedge between these two items is the source of his drive, which is Expectation.  In other words, changes in his expectation over the course of the story create direct responses in the level of The apostate ultramontane (Cons's satisfaction.  Only if Determination replaced Expectation would The apostate ultramontane (Cons be satisfied.

The apostate ultramontane (Cons is uniquely able to pursue this course as a result of his association with Ability.  At least, he would be able to if Value didn't always get in his way.  The frustrations The apostate ultramontane (Cons feels when he is held back only serve to increase the extent of his Concern with Playing a Role.  

In summary, The apostate ultramontane (Cons's primary Concern is a manner of thinking or demeanor regarding Playing a Role.  More specifically, he impacts the balance between Knowledge and Thought.  His primary influence is focused on Knowledge As a result, issues regarding Thought arise.  As The apostate ultramontane (Cons's impact grows, it tips the balance between Knowledge and Thought in the eyes of the other characters..  Affecting his impact are his drive regarding Expectation and his satisfaction with Determination.  Aided in this effort by his unique abilities in the area of Ability, he is held back by an aspect of Value.
