Cousin of Arnold [Bürkli (1833-1894) and Georg von Wyss [(1816-1893)]. Single [unmarried]. After interrupting the lower secondary school (1835-39) made B[ürkli] an apprentiship as tanner 1839-42. 1842-48 followed journeyman years: In Paris (1845-47) B[ürkli] learnt of the doctrine of Charles Fourier, which shaped him decisively. 1848-55 [stay] in Zurich, from 1851 onwards, B[ürkli] together with Johann Jakob Treichler opposed the government of Escher: In articles and translations he propagated the ideas of Fourier, called for peoples and exchange banks and consumer and producers' cooperatives in order to reform and overcome the capitalist system and establishing a just society in a socialist republic. Influenced by Moritz Rittinghausen he saw in a direct democracy the appropriate transitional form. B[ürkli] joined 1851 the Grütliverein, 1851 [he] was co-founder and until 1854 factory manager in the Consumers' Association Zürich (Konsumverein Zürich) and 1851-55 Grand Counciler [Cantonal Counciler]. The experiment prepared by him in 1854 to build in Texas a Phalanstère after [the theory of] Fourier failed [soon] after the emigration already in 1856. After returning to Zurich in 1858 to 1861 worked again as a factory manager in the Consumers' Association when he loast his struggle against the capitalist developments against Treichler. 1861-87 he managed as restaurateur an inn that becaume the center of oppositional movements. 1867-69 [he was] leader in the democratic movement, as was also a member of the 35er Commission of the Constitutional Council in 1868-69. Here he obtained the support for the cooperatives by the State. Earlier, he pled also for reforms of the Cantonal bank (Kantonalbank) and the military in the sense of people's army. 1869-78 and 1882-99 he was a member of the cantonal parliament, 1866-70 and 1893-1901 of the Gr[and] City Council of Zurich.
In 1866, B[ürkli] joined the [First] International, 1867-76, was the founder and pres[ident] of the section Zürich and actively participated in the meetings during its congresses in the Switzerland. From its beginning, he joined the social democratic workers' movement, which emerged in the last quarter of the 19th century. In addition to old claims he now pursued the introduction of proportional representation and made suggestions for the use of water power by the Stat. He also wrote works on the history of the old Confederation, among others, against the Winkelried myth that he critisized from his democratic position [...]. (Text in brackets added by author).
