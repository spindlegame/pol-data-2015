Plot Sequence Report for "Switzerland as a Direct Democracy"

This report shows how dramatic tension makes itself manifest in a series of discrepancies between plot and theme, act by act.

Information about the relationship between plot and theme comes in two forms in Dramatica.  When you begin creating your Storyform, you are presented with a "perfect world" view of your story in which plot is completely aligned with theme.  There is no discrepancy between the two, and therefore no dramatic tension.  This balanced view is most easily seen in the Theme Browser, available through a tile on the Dramatica Desktop.

Once you arrive at a Storyform, however, you have input information about how that "perfect world" is twisted and warped by problems and conflicting perspectives.  As a result, plot no longer matches theme, and the two are often quite out of step with one another.

As your story unfolds, it is the discrepancy between plot and theme that clues the audience in on the nature of the problem at the heart of your story and tells them much about the ways in which such a screwed up situation might be resolved.

Use this report as a guideline to the kinds of thematic considerations which should be addressed in your plot, act by act for each of the four throughlines.  By developing this series of plot/theme discrepancies, the progress of your story will reflect the dramatic tension of the effort to unwind all the tentacles of the central problem.
